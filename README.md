# 🏘️ Community Housing DAO

Welcome to the decentralized revolution in affordable housing! This Web3 project empowers communities to propose, vote on, and fund local affordable housing initiatives using a token-governed DAO on the Stacks blockchain. Say goodbye to bureaucratic red tape—hello to transparent, community-driven solutions for the global housing crisis.

## ✨ Features

🏠 **Project Proposals**: Submit detailed affordable housing plans with budgets and timelines  
🗳️ **Token-Based Voting**: Stake governance tokens to vote on proposals—your voice scales with commitment  
💰 **Automated Funding**: Approved projects receive milestone-based token disbursements from the DAO treasury  
🔒 **Secure Treasury**: Multi-sig-like controls prevent mismanagement of funds  
📊 **Impact Tracking**: On-chain reporting for transparency on project progress and outcomes  
👥 **Membership NFTs**: Hold an NFT to join the DAO and unlock proposal/voting rights  
⚖️ **Dispute Resolution**: Community arbitration for contested votes or fund releases  
🚫 **Anti-Sybil Measures**: Quadratic voting to ensure fair participation  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Community Proposers**  
- Mint a Membership NFT to gain DAO access  
- Call `submit-proposal` with your housing project details: location, budget (in STX/tokens), milestones, and expected impact  
- Proposals enter a review phase—gather endorsements from members  

**For Voters & Token Holders**  
- Acquire $HOUSING governance tokens (via initial mint or secondary markets)  
- Stake tokens in `vote-on-proposal` during the voting window—quadratic scaling rewards broad support  
- Watch as winning proposals (50%+ approval) trigger treasury transfers  

**For Project Beneficiaries**  
- Once approved, hit milestones and call `claim-funding` to release tokens/STX  
- Submit on-chain reports via `update-impact` to maintain transparency and eligibility for future funding  
- Disputes? Escalate to `initiate-arbitration` for DAO-mediated resolution  

That's it! Crowdfund real change, one block at a time.

- **Deployment**: Hiro's Clarinet for local testing; deploy to mainnet via stacks-cli  

## 🔗 Smart Contracts (8 Total)

This project leverages 8 Clarity smart contracts for robust, auditable functionality. Each is modular for easy upgrades and audits.

1. **`governance-token.clar`**: SIP-10 fungible token for $HOUSING—mint, transfer, and staking mechanics.  
2. **`membership-nft.clar`**: SIP-9 NFT for DAO entry—mint to verified community members.  
3. **`dao-core.clar`**: Central DAO hub—manages membership checks and global parameters (e.g., voting periods).  
4. **`proposal-manager.clar`**: Handles proposal submission, endorsements, and lifecycle (active/voting/approved/rejected).  
5. **`voting-engine.clar`**: Quadratic voting logic—stake tokens, tally votes, and enforce anti-Sybil rules.  
6. **`treasury-vault.clar`**: Secure storage for STX/tokens—only releases on quorum approval.  
7. **`milestone-releaser.clar`**: Milestone verification and automated fund claims for project teams.  
8. **`arbitration-module.clar`**: Dispute filing, juror selection (from token holders), and resolution voting.
